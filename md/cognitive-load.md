**Cognitive Load**

Learners' working memory is (a) limited to a capacity of about 4 pieces of novel information and (b) volatile with a duration for novel information of about 20 seconds. Existing schemas in long-term memory and used in working memory only occupy a tiny proportion of working memory resources. Cognitive load refers to the amount of working memory resources used.

| ------------- | ------------- |
|work with about 4 pieces of novel information to reduce intrinsic cognitive load|&#9744;| 
|use worked examples of scaffolded demonstrations of how to solve problems|&#9744;| 
|reduce scaffolding as learners progress from novice to expert|&#9744;| 
|reduce extrinsic load distractions to release more working memory resources|&#9744;|
