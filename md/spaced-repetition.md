**Spaced repetition**  

Spaced repetition is a technique to interrupt a learners' forgetting curve, the exponential decrease in memorisation with time. The forgetting curve is interrupted with the re-presentation of content or assessment items at intervals that are personalised to the learner. Similar to distributed practice.

| Learners:     |   |  
| ------------- | ------------- |
|revisit content or assessment items at increasing time intervals|&#9744;| 
|personalise time intervals using the Leitner or SM families of algorithms|&#9744;| 

**Example**  

Learners review content by flipping over flashcards presented in a carousel widget. Cards that were remembered correctly are queued to be re-presented after a defined time interval. Cards that were remembered incorrectly are queued to be re-presented after a shorter time interval.
