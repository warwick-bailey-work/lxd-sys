**Cognitive Dissonance**  

Cognitive dissonance occurs when a learner holds two contradictory ideas in their thinking about a phenomenon.  

The dissonance creates a valuable “learning moment” as the learner experiences a strong intrinsic motivation to resolve the physiological stress of the cognitive conflict.


| Learners:     |   |  
| ------------- | ------------- |
|express existing and alternative conceptualization about a phenomenon|&#9744;| 
|examine novel concrete scientific evidence about a phenomenon|&#9744;| 
|revise their own conceptualization to explain the phenomenon|&#9744;| 
|resolve the cognitive dissonance with the accepted scientific conceptualization |&#9744;|

**Example**  

Learners are presented with a phenomenon in a short video. Learners need to explicitly state and describe the phenomenon. 

Learners then explain the phenomenon using their current alternative conceptions. Each learner's explanations are captured using an online poll for use later in a synchronous class.
