**Dual coding**

Learners have two separate but cooperating memory systems for verbal and visual information that are additive. 

When the same information is made available to learners on both the verbal and visual channels, learners access more working memory capacity.

Cartoon-style sequences, labelled diagrams, infographics and timelines all combine text placed close to the corresponding part of an image. Combining and synchronising verbal and visual models strengthens long-term memory. 

Either the verbal channel or the visual channel, or both, may be overloaded.

| Learners:     |   |  
| ------------- | ------------- |
| use text and graphics at the same time, not text or graphics alone |&#9744;|
| use text placed appropriately on a graphic, not above or below it  |&#9744; |
| use narration and graphics only, not narration and graphics and on-screen text |&#9744;|

**Example**  

When text is placed close to the relevant part of the biological image, the learner uses verbal and visual channels together. The effect is additive. Verbal and visual models are integrated and long-term memory is strengthened. 

If text is placed far from the relevant part of an image in a key, the verbal and visual channels are not used together. The learner uses limited working memory resources to scan the picture to find a location for the text. Less working memory resources are available for learning.
