**Dual coding**

Learners have two separate but cooperating memory systems for verbal and visual information that are additive without increasing cognitive load: infographics, cartoon-style sequences, labelled diagrams and timelines. 

| Learners:     |   |  
| ------------- | ------------- |
| use text and graphics at the same time, not text or graphics alone |&#9744;|
| use text placed appropriately on a graphic, not above or below it  |&#9744; |
| use narration and graphics only, not narration and graphics and on-screen text |&#9744;|
